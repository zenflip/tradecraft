**Trading clarity through key distinctions.**

Most traders fail because they apply the same approach to every situation. They use high leverage everywhere and get liquidated. They chase every pump and miss the real moves. They stay in positions too long and watch profits evaporate.

**The difference between the 95% who fail and the 5% who thrive isn't talent—it's distinctions.** The more distinctions you understand, the better trader you become. When to use high leverage versus low leverage. When to scale in versus go all-in. When to exit at resistance versus hold for the continuation. These aren't just "tips"—they're survival tools.

This repository is a collection of trading concepts that bring clarity to decision-making. Each document explores a specific distinction that matters: [when to use high and low leverage](docs/high-and-low-leverage.md), [how to think in swings](docs/think-in-swings.md), [understanding margin for noise](docs/margin-for-noise.md), and more. The goal is simple: help you stay in the game long enough to join the small percentage who can use trading to live and thrive.

Trading is hard. Clarity makes it possible.
