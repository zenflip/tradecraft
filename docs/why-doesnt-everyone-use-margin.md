# Why doesn't everyone use margin over futures?

Margin spot seems cleaner and safer than perpetuals. So why isn't everyone using it?

You're right to notice this. Here's why most people don't use margin — and why smart traders often do.


## Why margin spot is actually great

### 1. You hold the real asset

- You're borrowing BTC or ETH, not a contract
- Easier to understand and transparent
- Not subject to funding rate manipulation

### 2. No funding rate volatility

- Perps have funding every 8 hours that can destroy profit in choppy markets
- Margin has fixed borrowing interest (Kraken's is clear and predictable)
- Funding rates can swing wildly, adding unpredictable costs

### 3. No cascading liquidations

- Futures engines liquidate in milliseconds when price spikes
- Margin gives you more buffer because you hold the asset itself, not a derivative contract
- Less vulnerable to coordinated liquidation hunts

### 4. Better alignment with spot charts

- Price action and indicators are "real"
- Futures often get distorted by liquidation hunts and short squeezes
- What you see is what you get

## So why doesn't everyone use margin spot?

Because of these trade-offs:

| Limitation | Explanation |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Lower available leverage** | Usually 2×–5× max (vs 100× on futures) |
| **Borrow interest** | You pay hourly/daily interest on borrowed funds, even if price doesn't move |
| **Limited pairs** | Kraken and others only offer margin on top pairs (BTC, ETH, etc.) |
| **Less flashy** | Perps attract gamblers and influencers because of big liquidation moves |
| **Execution slower** | Not as "fast and synthetic" as futures for scalpers or HFT bots |


## Margin vs futures: different tools for different traders

**Margin = "Investor leverage"**
- For people trading real trends, swing setups, or longer-term positions
- Requires patience and structure
- Safer for directional conviction

**Futures/Perps = "Speculator leverage"**
- For people trying to scalp volatility
- High risk of getting wiped out
- Better for short-term tactical plays


## The verdict

If you can manage position sizing (like a 2×–3× buffer approach), **margin spot is the superior way to trade directionally** — safer, cleaner, and far less likely to blow up an account.


## Detailed comparison: margin spot vs perpetual futures

Let's compare a real-world scenario:

**Assumptions:**
- You're long BTC at $100,000
- With $10,000 equity
- Using 3× leverage (≈ $30,000 position)
- BTC moves +10% or –10%

### Feature comparison

| Feature | Margin spot (Kraken) | Perpetual futures (Bybit/BitMEX) |
|:--------|:--------------------|:---------------------------------|
| **Underlying asset** | Real BTC borrowed and held | Synthetic contract only |
| **Leverage** | Usually up to 5×–10× | Up to 100× |
| **Funding cost** | Fixed interest (e.g. 0.02–0.05% per day) | Dynamic funding every 8h (can be 0–1%/day) |
| **P&L if BTC +10%** | +30% gain (3×) | +30% gain (3×) |
| **P&L if BTC –10%** | –30% loss (3×) | –30% loss (3×) |
| **Liquidation buffer** | ~33% drop at 3× (more conservative leverage typical) | ~33% drop at 3×, but users often use 10-50× (5-10% protection) |
| **Stop-loss type** | Sell stop (real coin) | Close stop (synthetic contract) |
| **Interest clock** | Always ticking until repaid | No interest, just funding payments |
| **Execution risk** | Low — actual spot liquidity | High — can slip or wick you out |
| **Market manipulation risk** | Very low | Very high (funding flips, liquidations) |
| **Emotional danger** | Boring, steady | Addictive, high dopamine |
| **Best use case** | Swing or trend trading | Scalping and hedging |
| **Settlement** | Physical (buy/sell BTC) | Virtual (contract P&L only) |

## Example outcome: 10% BTC move

| Move | Margin spot (3×) | Perpetual futures (3×) |
|:-----|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
| **+10%** | +$3,000 profit | +$3,000 profit |
| **–10%** | –$3,000 loss | –$3,000 loss |
| **–33%** | Liquidated (3× equity gone) | Liquidated sooner (depends on platform) |
| **+10% then sideways 10 days** | +$3,000 – $30 borrow cost | +$3,000 – $200 funding fees (approx.) |

*Note: The key difference emerges over time. Holding a position for 10 days costs ~$30 with margin but potentially $200+ with perpetuals due to volatile funding rates.*


## Summary

| Verdict | Explanation |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Margin spot = conservative power** | Safer, cleaner, predictable — best for swing trades, and you can hold longer |
| **Perps = casino leverage** | Great for quick tactical plays, but highly vulnerable to liquidation and funding costs |


## The bottom line

If your strategy is a swing trade where you "buy exhaustion, hold until resistance," **margin spot (2×–3×) is absolutely the right tool** — especially when you've got clear structure and risk limits.

You hold the real asset, avoid funding rate roulette, and get more breathing room against liquidation.
