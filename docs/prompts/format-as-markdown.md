# Format as markdown

## Prompt

Format this document as markdown with appropriate bold emphasis in the right places.

## Expected formatting

### Heading hierarchy
- **H1 (`#`)** - Document title
- **H2 (`##`)** - Major sections
- **H3 (`###`)** - Subsections and key points
- **H4 (`####`)** - Minor subsections (if needed)

### Bold emphasis (`**text**`)
Apply bold to:
- Key concepts and important terms
- Critical statements that deserve emphasis
- Action items and recommendations
- Section introductions that set up important points
- Conclusions or takeaways

### Punctuation in headings and lists
- **Headings**: Never use periods at the end
- **Bullet lists**:
  - **Complete sentences** (subject + verb): Use periods
  - **Fragments** (imperatives, labels, phrases): No periods
  - Be consistent within each list
- **Numbered lists**: Same rules as bullet lists

### Lists
- Use bullet lists for:
  - Questions
  - Tips and recommendations
  - Multiple related items
  - Action steps
- Use numbered lists for:
  - Sequential steps
  - Ranked items
  - Prioritized recommendations

### Content cleanup
- Remove promotional content (unless core to the message)
- Remove platform-specific calls-to-action (YouTube subscribe, likes, etc.)
- Remove filler phrases ("please remember", "make sure to", etc.)
- Keep the essential message and practical advice
- Maintain personal stories and examples that illustrate points

### Professional structure
- Clear sections with logical progression
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Strategic use of white space
- Bullet points for scannability
- Emphasis on readability

## Quality checklist

After formatting, verify:
- ✅ Clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- ✅ Strategic bold emphasis on key concepts
- ✅ Bullet/numbered lists where appropriate
- ✅ Removed promotional/platform-specific content
- ✅ Professional structure with logical flow
- ✅ Preserved core message and essential advice
- ✅ Enhanced readability and scannability
