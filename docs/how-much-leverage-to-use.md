# When to use high & low leverage

## Core principle

**Leverage should match conviction and clarity, not greed.**

Use high leverage when the setup is obvious and the risk/reward is time compressed. Use low (or no) leverage when you're scaling into uncertainty or building a position over time.

## High leverage (5X–10X+)

### When to use

Use high leverage in these scenarios:

1. **Clear breakout or breakdown**
   - Price breaks a well-defined range with volume
   - Momentum is clean and directional
   - Entry and stop are obvious

2. **Quick scalp with tight stop**
   - You're targeting a small move (1-3%)
   - Stop loss is very tight (0.5-1%)
   - Risk/reward is compressed but favorable

3. **High-probability reaction zone**
   - Price hits a major support/resistance
   - Multiple indicators align (MFI, volume, trendline)
   - You're expecting an immediate reaction

### Why it works

- **Speed matters** - The trade either works quickly or it doesn't
- **Defined risk** - Your stop is tight and clear
- **Capital efficiency** - You can take meaningful profit without tying up large capital
- **Clear invalidation** - You know exactly when you're wrong

### Example

BTC breaks $45K resistance with volume surge:
- Entry: $45,100
- Stop: $44,800 (0.67% risk)
- Target: $46,500 (3.1% gain)
- Leverage: 10X
- **Effective move: 31% gain if hit, 6.7% loss if stopped**

## Low leverage (1X–3X) or spot

### When to use

Use low or no leverage in these scenarios:

1. **Scaling into exhaustion**
   - You're building a position as price drops
   - You don't know exactly where the bottom is
   - You're averaging in at different levels

2. **Uncertain market conditions**
   - Choppy, rangebound price action
   - Mixed signals from indicators
   - No clear directional bias

3. **Long-term position building**
   - You're accumulating for a bigger move
   - Timeline is days/weeks, not hours
   - You can tolerate drawdown while thesis plays out

4. **After a big move**
   - Volatility is elevated
   - Price has already moved significantly
   - Risk of whipsaw is high

*Different market events create vastly different volatility profiles. After major moves or during event-driven volatility, lower leverage provides the breathing room needed to survive whipsaws.*

### Why It Works

- **Survival** - You can withstand being wrong multiple times
- **Flexibility** - You can add more if conditions improve
- **Stress management** - You won't get liquidated on normal volatility
- **Time advantage** - Your position can "breathe" and you can wait for momentum

### Example

ETH is dropping after a long run, MFI shows oversold:
- First entry: $2,000 (50% position, spot)
- Second entry: $1,850 (50% position, spot) if it drops further
- Stop: None (or very wide, like $1,600)
- Target: $2,400+ on recovery
- **No liquidation risk, can hold through volatility**

## Decision framework

Ask yourself these questions:

| Question | High leverage | Low/No leverage |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Is the setup obvious? | ✅ Yes, crystal clear | ❌ No, uncertain |
| Is my stop tight? | ✅ Yes, <1% risk | ❌ No, wider stops |
| Do I expect immediate movement? | ✅ Yes, within hours | ❌ No, could take days |
| Can I watch this trade actively? | ✅ Yes, I'm monitoring | ❌ No, need to set and forget |
| Is volatility low/normal? | ✅ Yes, stable conditions | ❌ No, choppy/volatile |
| Am I scaling in? | ❌ No, one entry | ✅ Yes, building position |

## Key Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **High leverage on a scaling strategy**
   - You'll get liquidated before your thesis plays out
   - Example: Using 10X while trying to "catch the bottom"

2. **High leverage in choppy markets**
   - You'll get stopped out by noise, not direction
   - Whipsaw will kill your position before momentum emerges

3. **Low leverage on obvious breakouts**
   - You'll make tiny gains on high-probability setups
   - You're leaving money on the table

4. **Overleveraging because "it feels right"**
   - Emotion is not an edge
   - If you can't define your stop and target clearly, use less leverage

## Risk management rules

### Position sizing

**Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of total capital**

Use the position sizing formula to calculate exact position sizes for any leverage level:

```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) / (Stop Loss % × Leverage)
```

**Example with 10X leverage**:
- Account: $10,000, Risk: 1% ($100), Stop: 0.5%, Leverage: 10X
- Position size: $10,000 × 1% / (0.5% × 10) = $2,000

For comprehensive position sizing guidance including worked examples, common mistakes, and advanced considerations, see [position-sizing-formula.md](position-sizing-formula.md).

### Universal rules

1. **Never risk more than 2% per trade** - Even on "sure things"
2. **Always define your stop before entering** - If you can't, don't trade
3. **Scale position size inversely to leverage** - Higher leverage = smaller position
4. **Account for slippage and fees** - Especially important on high leverage
5. **Don't add to losing positions on high leverage** - That's how you get liquidated

## Practical examples

### Scenario 1: BTC range break (high leverage)

**Setup:**
- BTC has been ranging \$43K-\$45K for 3 days
- Clean breakout above \$45K with volume
- MFI showing strength (>60)
- Entry is obvious, stop is clear

**Trade:**
- Entry: $45,200
- Stop: $44,700 (1.1% below entry)
- Target: $47,000 (4% move)
- Leverage: 8X
- Risk: 1% of account

**Rationale:** Clear setup, tight stop, immediate expected movement.

---

### Scenario 2: ETH accumulation (low/no leverage)

**Setup:**
- ETH has dropped 30% over 2 weeks
- MFI <20, showing exhaustion
- No clear bottom yet, but zone looks attractive
- Expecting days/weeks for recovery

**Trade:**
- First entry: $1,900 (50% of planned position, spot)
- Second entry: $1,750 if it drops further (remaining 50%)
- Stop: Very wide or none ($1,500 mental stop)
- Target: $2,400+ (25%+ gain)
- Leverage: None (spot only) or 2X margin

**Rationale:** Uncertain bottom, building position, need flexibility to average down.

---

### Scenario 3: Midday scalp (high leverage)

**Setup:**
- SOL just bounced off $100 support (3rd touch)
- 15min chart shows clear reversal pattern
- Tight stop, quick target

**Trade:**
- Entry: $101
- Stop: $99.50 (1.5% risk)
- Target: $104 (3% gain)
- Leverage: 10X
- Expected duration: 1-4 hours

**Rationale:** High probability reaction, tight stop, watching actively.

---

## Summary

### High leverage (5X-10X+)
✅ **Use when:** Clear setup, tight stop, immediate expected movement
✅ **Risk:** Defined and small (<1% stop)
✅ **Timeline:** Hours, not days
✅ **Attention:** Active monitoring required

### Low/No leverage (Spot or 1X-3X)
✅ **Use when:** Building position, uncertain conditions, longer timeline
✅ **Risk:** Can tolerate drawdown
✅ **Timeline:** Days to weeks
✅ **Attention:** Can be more passive

### Golden rule

**Your conviction should match your leverage, and your stop should always be defined before you enter.**

If you can't explain in one sentence why you're using that specific leverage amount, you're probably using too much.
