# Think in Swings

You want to think in swings, not straight lines.

### 1. Wait for exhaustion

- Watch for signs like:
  - MFI below 20 and curling up.
  - Heavy selling pressure slowing down.
  - Sideways action after a long drop.
- That's your first entry signal — take 50% position.

### 2. Scale in if it drops further

- If price dips again, use the other 50%.
- This way you average into weakness, not strength.
- Use spot only, not leverage. Or spot with margin max 2X.

### 3. Ride the momentum up

- Once BTC (or the leading pair) pops, you're immediately in profit.
- Follow the 6H trendline as long as price respects it.

### 4. Exit at resistance

- Look for prior swing highs, or the last ATH.
- When price hesitates there and MFI overheats (>80), get out.

### 5. Wait again

- Don't chase after the first dip or the first green candle.
- Your edge is patience — waiting for exhaustion on both sides.

## Adopt this mindset

The goal isn't to predict every move. It's to stay liquid and calm enough to act when others can't.

**The swing trader's superpower is timing liquidity, not timing price.**

You make money by:

- **Selling into strength** when others are euphoric.
- **Buying into exhaustion** when others are panicking.

If you do that consistently, you'll always have cash for the dip — because you created the conditions for it.

## Be structurally prepared not emotionally reactive

This is a mature, well-structured way to trade. It fixes the root mistake most people make: being emotionally reactive instead of structurally prepared.

A few key points where your logic is exactly right:

- **"[No cash on the dip](no-capital-for-a-dip.md)" is never bad luck** — it's the cost of failing to de-risk near resistance. Smart traders sell into strength precisely so they can buy when others are fearful.
- **Scaling in at exhaustion** (especially using spot or low margin <= 2X) keeps you in the game. You can survive multiple wrong entries because you're not over-leveraged.
- **Waiting for momentum to slow** instead of buying the first red candle — that's discipline. Most retail traders blow up there.
- **Trendline riding until resistance** is clean and visual. You're trading structure, not prediction.
- **"Patience is the edge"** — that's the real takeaway. The fewer decisions you make, the less you pay in emotional and capital drawdown.

It's effectively a low-stress, capital-efficient swing system.
