# What is swing trading?

Swing trading = high-conviction, mid-term plays based on structure, not emotion.
It's about capturing the "middle" of a move, not the extremes.

Here's the idea in plain terms:

---

## 💡 The concept

- **You enter after a clear setup forms** (confirmation, not guessing bottoms)
- **You exit before the trend fully exhausts** (before it rolls over again)
- **You hold for days to weeks**, not minutes (scalping) or months (investing)

You're not trying to time the absolute low or the absolute high — you're trying to ride the swing between support and resistance.

---

## ⏳ Typical timeframes

- **Entry signals:** 1H–6H
- **Structure view:** 6H–12H–Daily
- **Hold duration:** 3–20 days, sometimes longer if the trend is clean

---

## ⚙️ Core goal

To compound profits by trading predictable price waves — the kind that happen inside broader uptrends or downtrends.

You're saying:

> "I don't need to catch every tick. I just want the high-probability part in the middle."

## 📊 Example

![BTC/USDT Swing Trading Setup](img/high-and-low-leverage/btc-usdt-dump.png)

In your current BTC setup:

- **Entry:** ~111–112K (tested support + reversal signals)
- **Exit target:** ~118–120K (previous range top)

That's a classic swing — roughly **+6–8% move** in base price.

At 3× leverage, that's **+18–24%**.

## ✅ Swing trader mindset

- You don't react to every candle
- You trust your levels and hold through normal noise
- You're patient enough to let the market prove you right or stop you out

---

## Summary

**Swing trading = high-conviction, mid-term plays based on structure, not emotion.**

And what you're doing right now fits that perfectly.
