# Bodies vs wicks: What to use when drawing trend lines

Here's the rule of thumb traders use:

## 1. For structure/trend lines

**→ Use candle bodies as your anchor.**

They show where price actually closed — consensus value between buyers and sellers.

**Wicks are emotion; bodies are agreement.**

## 2. For channels and zones

**→ Include wicks to define the range of reaction.**

Wicks show where liquidity lives — where price overextended before snapping back.

## 3. Practical method

- **Draw your main trend line using body-to-body touches.**
- **Then widen it slightly to create a zone or channel that includes wicks.**
  - (That's your "noise tolerance.")
