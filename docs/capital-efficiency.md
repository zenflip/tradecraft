# Capital efficiency: doing more with less

**Capital efficiency = how much work your capital does**

It measures how effectively you use your money to get exposure to an asset or trade. You're not changing the risk profile of the trade â€” you're just using less capital to get the same exposure.


## Example: spot vs leverage

Say you want $10,000 worth of BTC exposure:

| Method | How much you commit | Effective exposure | Capital efficiency |
|:-------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| **Spot** | $10,000 | $10,000 | 1Ã— |
| **2Ã— leverage** | $5,000 margin + $5,000 borrowed | $10,000 | 2Ã— efficient |
| **3Ã— leverage** | $3,333 margin + $6,667 borrowed | $10,000 | 3Ã— efficient |

**â†’ You get the same exposure with less of your own money.**

This frees up the rest of your cash for other trades, hedges, or yield â€” that's capital efficiency.


## Key point

**Capital efficiency â‰  more risk.**

*It's about deploying less capital for the same controlled risk.* If you manage stops and position sizing properly, you're not increasing your probability of ruin â€” you're increasing the productivity of your capital.


## When it becomes dangerous

Capital efficiency turns from **efficiency â†’ gambling** when:

- You use leverage to **increase position size** instead of reduce capital used
- You skip stop-losses or hedge planning
- You let margin risk dictate your position instead of your plan


## In short

Capital efficiency is the **smart use of leverage to do more with less**, not reckless leverage to risk more than you should.


## Capital efficiency vs leverage: where it breaks down

Here's how capital efficiency scales with leverage, and where it stops being useful and starts getting fragile:

| Leverage | Own capital used | Effective exposure | Capital efficiency | Liquidation buffer | Risk profile | Comment |
|:---------|:----------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:-------------|:--------|
| **1Ã— (Spot)** | 100% | 1Ã— | 1Ã— | None | ðŸ”µ Safe | Full exposure, no liquidation risk |
| **1.5Ã—** | 67% | 1Ã— | 1.5Ã— | â€“66% | ðŸŸ¢ Efficient | Still very safe, mild borrowing |
| **2Ã—** | 50% | 1Ã— | 2Ã— | â€“50% | ðŸŸ¢ Optimal | Efficient & robust swing zone |
| **3Ã—** | 33% | 1Ã— | 3Ã— | â€“33% | ðŸŸ  Tense | Noise can start hurting |
| **5Ã—** | 20% | 1Ã— | 5Ã— | â€“20% | ðŸ”´ Fragile | Normal daily swings can liquidate |
| **10Ã—** | 10% | 1Ã— | 10Ã— | â€“10% | ðŸ”´ High risk | Intraday volatility kills position |
| **20Ã—+** | 5% or less | 1Ã— | 20Ã— | â€“5% or less | âš« Suicide | You're trading noise, not structure |


## Key insights

### Capital efficiency peaks around 2â€“3Ã—

Beyond that, each extra turn of leverage gives you less safety than the marginal gain in efficiency.

**Example:** 2Ã— doubles efficiency with â€“50% buffer; 5Ã— only adds 2.5Ã— efficiency but slashes buffer to â€“20%.

### Volatility eats margin nonlinearly

Every extra step of leverage increases the probability of ruin **exponentially, not linearly**.

### Past 3Ã—, you're not efficient â€” you're fragile

You can't survive ordinary drawdowns. You start needing stops, constant monitoring, and emotional fortitude.

See [Does a stop-loss help?](does-a-stop-loss-help.md) for a detailed discussion on why 2Ã— leverage changes your stop-loss strategy.

**Short answer:** At 2Ã—, you're trading structure, not noise. Your liquidation buffer IS your stop â€” it's just 50% wide. This is often better than tight stops that get hit by normal volatility.
