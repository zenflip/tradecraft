# No capital for a dip

People often say:

> "It's always when there's a dip, there's no cash to buy it!"

That's not bad luck. **It's bad planning.**

If you had exited at resistance when momentum was clearly fading, you'd have cash ready. But most traders stay in too long, convinced the run will continue. Then when price dumps, they're "all in," watching from the sidelines as real opportunity appears.

**The problem isn't the dip â€” it's the failure to prepare for the dip.**
