## Instructions for AI assistants:

## Slash Command System

When users type slash commands, respond with the following workflows:

### `/codefu`
**CRITICAL**: Read and follow EVERY step in `docs/check-me.md`

Please read docs/check-me.md first and follow all the AI assistant instructions in my documentation. Once you have read "check-me.md" respond: "I know codefu!" and continue following these instructions.

### `/commit` - Atomic Git Commit Workflow
**CRITICAL**: Read and follow EVERY step in `docs/guidelines/atomic-git-commits.md`

This document contains the complete three-pass atomic commit methodology.

This workflow file contains the complete NextJS development process.

## Workflow Execution Requirements
